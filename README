This is the (alpha) C SDK for Launch Darkly. It implements the "mobile" SDK.

BUILDING

Should build with make in a posix (linux) environment. Requires libcurl to be installed.

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation for exported functions exists in the DOCS.txt file.

CONVENTIONS

Exported functions and types have an LD prefix to avoid namespace collisions.

Internal functions which may leak into the application namespace have an LDi
prefix for Launch Darkly internal. They should not be used by application code.
